> Compat Note: In Babel 6, this method was synchronous and transformSync did not exist. For backward-compatibility, this function will behave synchronously if no callback is given. If you're starting with Babel 7 and need synchronous behavior, please use transformSync since this backward-compat may be dropped in future major versions of Babel.
